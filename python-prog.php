	<h3><b><font color="red">INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON</font></b></h3>
		 <p class="MB0">Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language.Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C.<br><br>

Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles. It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and has a large and comprehensive standard library.

<h3><b><font color="red">HISTORY OF PYTHON</font></b></h3><br>
<img src="images/python_founder.jpg" height="300" wodth="300"><br><br>
<p class="MB0">Python was conceived in the late 1980s and its implementation was started in December 1989by Guido van Rossum at CWI in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL) capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.
<br><br>
Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features including a full garbage collector and support for Unicode. With this release the development process was changed and became more transparent and community-backed
 </p> <br><br>



		 <font color="red"><b>What is PYTHON?</b></font><br>
<br>The core philosophy of the language is summarized by the document "PEP 20 (The Zen of Python)", which includes aphorisms such as:
    <br>1-Beautiful is better than ugly
    <br>2-Explicit is better than implicit
    <br>3-Simple is better than complex
    <Br>4-Complex is better than complicated
    <br>5-Readability counts
