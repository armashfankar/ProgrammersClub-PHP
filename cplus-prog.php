	<h3><b> <font color="red">INTRODUCTION TO C++ PROGRAMMING</font></b></h3>
		 <p class="MB0">C++ is one of the most popular programming languages[4][5] and is implemented on a wide variety of hardware and operating system platforms. As an efficient performance driven programming language it is used in systems software, application software, device drivers, embedded software, high-performance server and client applications, and entertainment software such as video games.<br><br>

<p class="MB0">

Bjarne Stroustrup, a Danish and British trained computer scientist, began his work on C++'s predecessor "C with Classes" in 1979.[7] The motivation for creating a new language originated from Stroustrup's experience in programming for his Ph.D. thesis. Stroustrup found that Simula had features that were very helpful for large software development.
<br>
In 1983, it was renamed from C with Classes to C++ (++ being the increment operator in C). New features were added including virtual functions, function name and operator overloading, references, constants, user-controlled free-store memory control, improved type checking.<br>

		 <font color="red"><b>What is C++ Programming?</b></font><br>
		<br>
C++ provides a collection of predefined classes, along with the capability of user-defined classes. The classes of C++ are data types,which can be instantiated any number of times. Class definitions specify data objects (called data members) and functions (called member function). Classes can name one or more parent classes, providing inheritance and multiple inheritance, respectively. Classes inherit the data members and member functions of the parent class that are specified to be inheritable. Therefore it is mainly used for:
<br>
   <br>1- Software Engineering
   <br>2- Graphics
